I've been meaning to write about pornography for as long as I've
managed this blog, but never came around to do it because nothing that
goes through my mind hasn't already been written in a more eloquent
and elaborate fashion by radical feminists.  I can only recommend the
works of Andrea Dworkin and other anti-pornography feminists.

Nevertheless, here's a "manifesto" of my position for future reference
and for the sake of cataloguing my thoughts.


[Content warning: extreme sexual violence.]


## Etymology

Let's see what's at the root of the word "pornography" first.

- "pornai" (πόρναι): sex slave, "cheap whore"
- "graphikos" (γραφικός): something written or painted

The second part is obvious; pornography are certain graphical
depictions.

The first part, however, escapes most of modern western civilization,
which loves to fawn over pornography as a progressive symbol of sexual
liberation.

Here's an elaboration on the meaning, from Wikipedia:

> The "pornai" (πόρναι) were found at the bottom end of the scale.
> They were, as alluded to by the etymology—the word comes from
> pernemi πέρνημι "to sell"—the property of pimps or pornoboskós
> (πορνοβοσκός), who received a portion of their earnings.  [...]  In
> the classical era of ancient Greece, pornai were slaves of barbarian
> origin; starting in the Hellenistic era the case of young girls
> abandoned by their citizen fathers can be added.  They were
> considered to be slaves until proven otherwise.  [...]  In regards
> to price, there are numerous allusions to the price of one obolus
> [very roughly a few bucks] for a cheap prostitute; no doubt for
> basic acts.  It is difficult to assess whether this was the actual
> price or a proverbial amount designating a "good deal".

Pornai were literally sex slaves, arguably beneath regular slaves in
the social hierarchy.  From records alluding to their price we can't
even tell whether the price is meant literally or a proverbial phrase
comparable to "a few bucks".

It's fair to assume that in the eyes of society, they were basically
"cheap whores."

So the concept of pornography is that you watch graphical depictions
of women you perceive to be literal sex slaves, or cheap whores, and
find entertainment in this.

You could say it's like finding entertainment in watching what goes on
inside a slaughterhouse or a sweatshop.

Now I hear you say, "that's argument by etymology, a fallacy!"  The
meanings of words change, and surely this ancient meaning has nothing
to do with the word's current usage, right?

Leaving aside the irony --and especially the sheer callousness-- of
gleefully referencing a system of actual sex slavery in a concept you
deem to be sexually liberatory, let's see how modern pornography
looks.


## Content

Depending on how you define "violence" and what study you look at, you
get pretty wildly different numbers, but no matter how you define it,
the rates of violence against women in pornography are very
substantial to put it softly.

### Palys, 1986

I can't find the original study, but it's referenced in many other
publications.  According to an [article
](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201606/how-much-porn-depicts-violence-against-women)
on Psychology Today that **defends** pornography, the study found
**36% of porn scenes** to depict **violence against women**.

According to [Pornography and Rape: A Causal Model
](http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Diana-Russell-Pornography-and-Rape-A-causal-Model.pdf)
published in 1988:

> T.S. Palys found that 19% of all the scenes coded in a sample of 150
> sexually oriented home videos involved aggression, and 13% involved
> sexual aggression. (1986, pp. 26, 27) [...]  Of all the sexually
> aggressive scenes in the "adult" videos, 46% involved bondage or
> confinement; 23%, slapping, hitting, spanking, or pulling hair; 22%,
> rape; 18%, sexual harassment; 4%, sadomasochism; and 3%, sexual
> mutilation. (1986, p. 31)

### Cowan, 1988

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1988.tb00945.x/full

> The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of domination
> and sexual inequality in x-rated videocassettes through a content

> was randomly drawn from a list of 121 adult movie titles widely
> available in family videocassette rental stores in southern
> California.  **Over half of the explicitly sexual scenes** were
> coded as **predominantly concerned with domination or
> exploitation**.  Most of the domination and exploitation was
> directed by men toward women.  Specific indicators of domination and
> sexual inequality, including physical violence, occurred frequently.

*(Emphasis mine.)*

According to the previously mentioned Psychology Today article, this
study found **23% of scenes** to depict **violence against women**.

### Duncan, 1991

### McKee, 2005

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19827232

http://eprints.qut.edu.au/14545/1/14545.pdf

The author, Alan McKee, is a public proponent of pornography, trying
to back his ideology with junk science.

The study defines violence as "Any form of behaviour directed toward
the goal of harm; or injuring another living being **who is motivated
to avoid such treatment.**" *(Emphasis mine.)* The last clause is an
intentional strategy used by the author to dramatically lower the
numbers, as **most pornography depicts the woman as being willing to
suffer the violence committed against her**.  Through this loophole,
McKee concludes that only 2% of pornography contains violence.

The study also contains idiotic definitions of "objectification" that
miss the point (like lack of interaction with the camera) only to
conclude that porn actually objectifies men more than women.  The
shock!

### Bridges et al., 2010

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20980228

> Of the **304 scenes** analyzed, **88.2%** contained **physical
> aggression**, principally spanking, gagging, and slapping, while
> **48.7% of scenes** contained **verbal aggression**, primarily
> name-calling.  Perpetrators of aggression were usually male, whereas
> targets of aggression were overwhelmingly female.  **Targets most
> often showed pleasure or responded neutrally to the aggression.**

*(All emphasis mine.)*

Of the victims of violence in the analyzed scenes, 94.4% were women,
putting us at 88.2 * 94.4/100 = **~83%** frequency of **violence
against women**.

This study contains many other interesting statistics as well, by the
way, such as:

> Male-to-female oral sex [cunnilingus] was found to occur in 53.9% of
> the scenes coded, less than anal sex which appeared in 55.9% of the
> scenes.

In other words: **in pornography, women get anally penetrated by men
more frequently than they receive cunnilingus from men.**

> The ATM [ass-to-mouth] sequence occurred in 41.1% of scenes.

Ass-to-mouth is when the man anally penetrates the woman, pulls out,
then orally penetrates her without cleaning his penis.  It is
sometimes described as "making the woman eat shit," due to the
likelihood of fecal matter entering the woman's throat.

### Summary

Pornography makes violence and statutory rape "sexy."

The content of pornography is, by large, extremely hateful towards
women.  Depending on your sources, ~14% to ~83% of scenes contain
explicit, physical acts of violence against women.  If such acts of
violence were performed on any other class of people (such as blacks,
Jews, or disabled people), they would surely be recognized as hate
crimes.

"But it's just sexual fantasies" I hear you say.  It's not hate
speech, because nobody is incited to commit violence, right?..

First of all, I would like to see you defend racist jokes using the
argumentation that it's "just jokes" and it "won't hurt anyone."  If
we understand that racist jokes and language create a hateful
atmosphere (in which violent attitudes *may* eventually arise), why
can we not acknowledge that gleeful mass-consumption and talk of
pornography can do the same?

Finding pornography distasteful to say the least --and utterly
abhorrent to be more blunt-- is not (necessarily) a sign of
childishness, prudishness, or attachment to conservative morals.  It
may well arise from a commitment to upholding the dignity of all human
beings, without compromise.  (And if you cannot imagine sexuality with
love and cheerfulness instead of violence and degradation, you're in
dire need of some personal growth.)

And secondly, I've got more bad news in the following section.


## The effects

Sociology is hard.  It is literally impossible to put two whole
societies into a pair of lab tubes, make sure that they are 100% the
same except for one key difference (like society A accepting porn
while society B abhors it), then observe how they develop over the
next few decades or centuries.  We could do this if we were gods, but
being mortals, we need to rely on much more indirect ways of measuring
the effect of particular cultural elements on society, such as the
effect of pornography.

The same dilemma exists when researching the psychological formation
of individual people.  It is impossible (morally and legally, if not
practically) to put a pair of genetic twins into entirely identical
lab environments from which they are not allowed to escape, and treat
them in 100% the same way except for altering very specific aspects of
their life.  So once again, there is a fundamental necessity for
indirect measures and a lot of conjecture if we want to test how porn
really affects a person in the long term.

For every study that concludes there is a plausible link between
pornography and further sexual violence (apart from the one that
already happened to the performer, that is) on a societal as well as
individual level, you won't have much difficulty finding a
counter-study claiming that no such link exists.

However, there is a clear base-line to be drawn here: there exist
studies providing evidence for a concrete link between consumption of
pornography, and misogyny; counter-studies published by porn-loving
men notwithstanding.  Also, if there is only a split chance that a
culture of pornography leads to one more rape or one more incidence of
child sexual abuse, that should be enough ground to oppose it.  And we
have evidence for more than just a split chance.

She goes on to elaborate on her theory, explaining plausible links
between a culture of pornography and men's propensity to rape, and
even sexually abuse children.

### Hald et al., 2010

http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/00arsr11.pdf

This meta-analysis suggests that there is a complex link between
consumption of violent pornography and rape-supportive attitudes in
certain populations of men.

### Malamuth et al., 1986

https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/W/

This older study has concluded that found that the quantity of
pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with
degree to which they endorsed sexual assault.

The study references Check, 1984, who found among a sample of Canadian
men that more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of rape
myths, violence against women, and general sexual callousness.  In
another study, Briere et al., 1984, similar correlations were reported
in a sample involving college males.

### Anecdotes

Feminist literature will occasionally include anecdotes by women who
report being raped in direct relation to the porn use of the
rapist(s).

The following are taken from 'Life and Death' by Andrea Dworkin,
although they are originally testimonies given for the Dworkin &
MacKinnon Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance at the Minneapolis
Public Hearings.

> She was thirteen.  She was at a Girl Scout camp in northern
> Wisconsin.  She went for a long walk in the woods alone during the
> day.  She had long blond hair.  She saw three hunters reading
> magazines, talking, joking.  One looked up and said: "There's a live
> one."  She thought they meant a deer.  She ducked and started to run
> away.  They meant her.  They chased her, caught her, dragged her
> back to where they were camped.  The magazines were pornography of
> women she physically resembled: blond, childlike.  They called her
> names from the pornography: Little Godiva, Golden Girl, also bitch
> and slut.  They threatened to kill her.  They made her undress.  It
> was November and cold.  One held a rifle to her head; another beat
> her breasts with his rifle.  All three raped her--penile penetration
> into the vagina.  The third one couldn't get hard at first so he
> demanded a blow job.  She didn't know what that was.  The third man
> forced his penis into her mouth; one of the others cocked the
> trigger on his rifle.  She was told she had better do it right.  She
> tried.  When they were done with her they kicked her: they kicked
> her naked body and they kicked leaves and pine needles on her.
> "[T]hey told me that if I wanted more, that I could come back the
> next day."

Remember that the above is a real story, as is the following.

> She was raped by two men.  They were acting out the pornographic
> video game "Custer's Revenge."  She was American Indian; they were
> white.  "They held me down and as one was running the tip of his
> knife across my face and throat he said, 'Do you want to play
> Custer's Last Stand?  It's great.  You lose but you don't care, do
> you?  You like a little pain, don't you, squaw.'  They both laughed
> and then he said, 'There is a lot of cock in Custer's Last Stand.
> You should be grateful, squaw, that all-Amerikan boys like us want
> you.  Maybe we will tie you to a tree and start a fire around you.'"

And finally, child abuse:

> She was sexually abused when she was three by a boy who was
> fourteen--it was a "game" he had learned from pornography.  "[I]t
> seems really bizarre to me to use the word 'boy' because the only
> memory I have of this person is as a three year old.  And as a three
> year old he seemed like a really big man."


## The industry

Now comes a completely different dimension of the problem: where
pornography comes from.  Even ignoring all of the misogyny in the end
product, porn is produced under dire conditions in the first place.
Even when it isn't literally filmed rape, that is.

### Javanbakht et al., 2014

http://www.aidshealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Adult-film-poster-STD-Prevention-2014.pdf

This study by the UCLA looked at 366 performers, 3/4 of them women.

Only 6.3% of the performers always used a condom.  A whole 69% never
used one.

23.7% of the subjects had contracted gonorrhea or chlamydia.  (It's
unknown what percent got it from shooting porn and what percent from
their private life, though.)

20% used cocaine, 18.3% ecstasy, 19.2% XanaX, 12.7% Vicodin, 5% Meth,
2.4% Heroin.

36.5% had done double-penetration scenes, 24.4% fisting, 14.1%
double-vaginal, 9.5% double-anal.

15.4% had to "perform sexual favors to get work" -- in other words,
got raped.  10.3% had been physically hurt during a shoot.  13.6% had
to do sex acts they didn't want to do.  16.4% were **not paid at the
end of a job**.

### Fielding et al., 2009

https://www.shelleylubben.com/sites/default/files/LA_Public_Health_9-17-09.pdf

From 2004 to the end of the study, the Department of Public Health
(DPH) received reports of 2,396 cases of Chlamydia, 1389 cases of
gonorrhea, and five syphilis cases from STD screening organizations
within the porn industry.  20.2% of performers diagnosed with STD had
one or more repeat infections within a one year period.

Analyses of 2008 data indicated that porn performers have a much
higher rate of infection (20%) than the general public (2.4%).

### Shelley Lubben

https://www.shelleylubben.com/

Lubben is an ex-porn star who has since turned to religion and
campaigns against the porn industry.  Her website keeps statistics of
dead porn stars.

Between 2003 and 2014, Lubben et al. have counted 228 deaths caused by
AIDS, suicide, homicide, drugs, and premature deaths from unexplained
causes.  70 of the deaths were from suicide, 38 from drugs.

### Millward, 2013

http://jonmillward.com/blog/studies/deep-inside-a-study-of-10000-porn-stars/

"Data Journalist" Jon Millward analyzed a data set of 10,000 female
porn performers.

According to his results, 87% of performers take facial ejaculation,
62% do anal, 39% do double-penetration, 31% swallow ejaculate, 11% do
scenes in which they urinate, 10% take double-vaginal penetration, 6%
take fisting, 5% do scenes in which someone urinates on them, and 5%
take double-anal penetration.

### Anecdotes

#### Gail Dines

http://gaildines.com/

Prof. Gail Dines, sociologist, researches the porn industry closely.
In personal conversations with doctors within the industry who watch
over performers, she learned that the practice of ass-to-mouth
sometimes leads to **fecal infections in the throat**.

Similarly, citing her ties within the industry as a source, she has
stated that the average time a woman spends within the industry, as
acknowledged by pornographers themselves, is three months, after which
the women tend to be too physically and mentally exhausted.

All of this is from the top Google result for the search query "ex
porn star".  (You really only need to search "ex porn star", and
Google already kinda knows what you mean.)  Many more such stories can
be found through such simple searches, and if I tried to include all
the ones I can easily find, this article would grow twice in size and
start looking like some sort of psychological horror literature.

### Summary

All in all, the porn industry treats performers like shit, and a great
number of them suffer health issues you won't get from any other job.

Women being treated like subhumans, like the Nazis treated Jews,
Romani people, or disabled people, occurs with some frequency in the
porn industry.  It might be rare in relative terms, but the atmosphere
does allow it.


## Fun facts and conclusion

Porn is not anti-conservative.  Some of the [biggest consumers of porn
worldwide
](http://postober.com/general/top-10-countries-that-watch-the-most-porn/)
in 2015 are Islamist countries: number one is Pakistan, Egypt second,
Iran fourth, Morocco fifth, Saudi Arabia seventh, and Turkey is number
eight in the global index.  (Yeah, may as well consider Turkey an
Islamist nation at this point.  Fuck you, Erdoğan.)  Moreover,
according to [CovenantEyes](http://www.covenanteyes.com/pornstats/),
self-described "fundamentalist" Christians have a 91% higher chance of
watching porn.

Pornography reenacts the conservative model of a relationship in which
the man dominates the woman.  It takes this to a literal extreme of
physical domination, where in older conservative cultures said
domination is enacted through legal institutions such as marriage, in
which a man gains legal ownership over a woman.  So the method has
changed, but the root idea has not: man dominates woman.

Given all of this, it becomes a no-brainer to oppose pornography on
the basis of women's rights and liberation from male supremacy, as
well as principles of basic human dignity.  Transsexuals, gay men, and
even heterosexual men aren't necessarily portrayed much better in porn
either, after all.

If there is a graphical depiction of people making sincere love to
each other, rather than practicing dominance and submission, then that
is quite literally not pornography, even if liberals insist on calling
it so under the strategy of normalizing pornography.  Watch out for
the publisher however, as such graphical publications may nevertheless
stem from the porn industry and finance the production of actual
pornography anyway.  "Erotica" is frequently just porn for those too
fancy to use the word "porn."

This concludes the manifesto.  Congratulations if you've read through
it all.  If you want more, you are highly advised to read Andrea
Dworkin's works, many of which are concerned with pornography:
http://radfem.org/dworkin
