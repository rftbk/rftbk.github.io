I found the following PDF buried beneath many other files in my PC's
"temporary files" directory, where I put stuff that I intend to look
into some day and am too lazy to archive somewhere proper:

[Evidence supporting the biological nature of gender identity
](/files/trans/2014 Saraswat et al: Biological Gender ID.pdf)

It's a meta analysis, i.e. a study summing up many other studies.

For the record, here's the study on PubMed; I don't remember how I got
my hands on the actual PDF above:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25667367

Like any human being, I'm also very prone to cognitive biases (we all
are), and I managed to bury this file away for a long time instead of
seriously looking into it, obviously because of the subconscious fear
of having deeply held ideals challenged by material evidence.

So finally I forced myself to carefully read through it.  It's pretty
biased in its own interpretations and conclusions to say the least, so
here's some counter-bias...

> A seminal study by Meyer-Bahlburg et al involving outcomes of XY
> individuals raised as females due to severe non-hormonal, anatomic
> abnormalities of sex development has provided the most convincing
> evidence that gender identity is fixed.

The study in question: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16010465 

So let's see what the **most convincing evidence** has to say.

> These congenital abnormalities include penile agenesis, cloacal
> exstrophy [of the bladder], and penile ablation.

Firstly, let's check out what these conditions are.  Penile agenesis
means that the penis isn't properly formed, cloacal exstrophy is a
severe condition where internal organs like the bladder and intestines
are exposed (the study looked at those in whom the bladder was
exposed), and penile ablation means the penis was somehow botched,
like in a botched circumcision.

I don't know the exact kids in question, but as far as I understand,
these conditions don't exactly make the genetically male child look
like an average female, like for instance it is the case in complete
androgen insensitivity syndrome.

So just like in the often cited Bruce Reimer case, it's unlikely that
a child with these conditions had a normal female upbringing as if the
parents and everyone actually believed the child to be female.  It's
quite likely that the parents' and other adults' knowledge of the
child to not be a normal female has reached the child in some way.
Possibly in quite major ways: perhaps the child even heard the doctors
explicitly say that the child is really male, just lacking a normal
penis.

It would help our analysis quite a lot to know to what extent the
child was actually convinced to be a normal female...

> In this study, it was observed that 78% of all female-assigned 46 XY
> patients were living as females.  While the majority of these
> patients did not initiate a gender change to male, none of the 15
> male-raised 46 XY patients initiated a gender change to female.

So...  Sure, one way to frame this is: a whopping 22% of these people
decided to change their social sex in accordance with the gender
identity you would expect them to have (since most genetic males are
"cis" i.e. "have male gender identity", most of these kids raised
female would really be expected to have male gender identity), so this
hints to inborn gender identity, right?

Well, another way to frame it is: a whopping 78% of these genetically
and hormonally normal males, who must almost all have had a male
gender identity, were quite fine living as women.  Where is the
debilitating gender dysphoria?  99% of them should have developed
dysphoria, not a mere 22%.

Even for those 22% we don't know if they changed social sex because of
"gender dysphoria" or for other reasons, like growing broad shoulders,
a deep voice, an Adam's apple, and a beard...  None of which are
prevented by being born with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy, or
penile ablation, remember?

Again though, it would help our analysis a great deal if we had
precise information on how many of these kids were also treated with
female hormones to ensure a feminine physique.  No such information is
mentioned anywhere in the meta analysis study, nor the Meyer-Bahlburg
study, so we're left guessing whether *maybe* they actually developed
dysphoria, or just looked into mirror and said "you know, fuck it, I'm
obviously a guy LOL."

Oh and also, let's see what the actual conclusion of the study in
question is, from the study itself, not the biased meta analysis:

> The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later
> patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female
> assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless
> incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender
> identity by prenatal androgens.

Well, shit.

Moving on.

> A study by the same group examined the degree of satisfaction with
> surgical intervention reported by patients with 46 XY genotype also
> found that those subjects raised as boys were considerably more
> comfortable with their gender identity.

It means this study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15017234

Let's quote the parts of it that are public:

> PURPOSE: We surveyed a clinic sample of adult 46,XY intersex
> patients regarding attitudes to clinical management policies.

OK, and then?

> CONCLUSIONS: The majority of adult patients with intersexuality
> appeared to be satisfied with gender and genital status, and did not
> support major changes in the prevailing policy.

Almost would have guessed!

For the record though, I cut off the last sentence:

> However, a significant minority was dissatisfied and endorsed policy
> changes.

I can understand that, since we're talking about intersex people, some
of whom were likely "treated" unnecessarily.  Sadly we have no further
insight into their responses to know what they really meant.

OK so that's the **most convincing evidence** out of the way.  Let's
go on.

> Another seminal study relevant to this topic was by Reiner and
> Gearhart in their review of 16 XY genotype subjects with cloacal
> exstrophy who underwent female gender reassignment surgery.

The study: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022236

> Out of the 14 individuals raised as girls, 4 announced they were
> male and 4 later chose to live as boys when they became aware of
> their genotype.  The 2 individuals who were raised as males
> identified as males throughout life.

Once again we have no information on whether these genetically male
children were treated with hormones, or whether they were left to go
through male puberty, which could explain why they begin to see
themselves as male.

4 of them saying that they're male after learning that ... they're
literally male should not come as a surprise though, to say the least.

> The sexual behavior and attitudes of all 16 subjects ultimately
> reflected strong masculine characteristics regardless of gender
> assignment.

Hey, thanks for admitting so openly that "gender identity" is about
stereotypes!

> Thus, children who were born genetically and hormonally male
> identified as males despite being raised as females and undergoing
> feminizing genitoplasty at birth.

Except for the 78% of the previous study you mean, which had a sample
size that's less of a joke.

> Although cohort size in these studies is small, these data provide

Ah, the **strongest evidence** you say?

**Damn** that was underwhelming.

Going on.

> In congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) the adrenal glands produce

Translation: if you're an abnormally masculine girl due to a medical
condition, you have a higher chance of developing "serious problems
with [your] gender identity."

Sounds almost like "serious problems with gender identity" could
result from being bullied for not being feminine enough.  Curious!

Note also how the percentage is much lower when compared to the
genetic males, who were also raised female but lacked a vagina, in
whose case occurrence of "FTM" transgenderism (if we may call it so)
was as high as 22%.  Could it be that having a vagina is related in
some way to your likelihood of accepting the notion that you're
female?  Hmm.

The study, BTW: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16010462

In other words, subtract a vagina from the equation and a child's
chances of identifying themselves as male *miraculously* skyrockets.

Just how!?

support ... might be attributed ... on some occasions

Maybe!

The study in question: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16010463

The study itself is a lot more honest on what that "on some occasions"
bit means:

> If prenatal exposure to androgens is a major contributor to gender
> identity development, one would expect that all, or nearly all,
> affected individuals, even when raised as girls, would develop a

> changes occur frequently, but not invariably.

So much for "muh inborn gender identity!!1" (Sorry, had to meme at
this point.)

To their credit though:

> In these two syndromes, the degree of external genital
> masculinization at birth does not seem to be related to gender role
> changes in a systematic way.

Just as an aside, a relatively simple hypothesis NONE of these studies
ever mention: prenatal androgen or other hormone exposure or whatever
the fuck may have a slight statistical effect on the outcome of your
inborn personality alignment and as such make you more likely to
become a healthily effeminate boy or a healthily masculine girl, which
*in turn* may cause you to develop gender dysphoria *because of
society*.  Why does nobody ever talk about this?

I'm going to stop at this point because I can't type too much at once
(it causes me severe back pain sometimes), and the meta analysis goes
on and on pointing at other studies (lots of brain sex stuff too), and
remember we've covered the **most convincing evidence** already, so
I'll leave it to your imagination how biased the rest is.


So long, and kind regards,
