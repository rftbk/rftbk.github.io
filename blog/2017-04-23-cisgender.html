<p>Trigger warning: questioning of the validity of transgender identity.</p>
<p>First of all, if one defines &quot;transgender&quot; as a manifestation of gender dysphoria, a psychological disorder that entails severe discomfort with sexual parts of one's anatomy and a fixation with being seen as a member of the opposite sex, then my complaint doesn't apply. Because in that case, transitioning would simply be seen as a coping mechanism for people who have said disorder, and &quot;cisgender&quot; would simply mean &quot;not having that disorder&quot; (or having it but choosing to cope through different means).</p>
<p>But in contemporary discourse, &quot;transgender&quot; seems to be defined not in terms of a disorder, but in terms of identification with certain social categories, which is then thought to reflect a person's inner nature and true self.</p>
<p>For example: I'm a person whose body is categorized as &quot;male&quot; by the science of biology, and I feel OK with my body, and don't show a phobic reaction to being called he, a man, etc. But if I nevertheless find myself at odds with being lumped together with other males (many of whom I find unpleasant and cannot &quot;identify with&quot; at all), then the logic seems to say that I fall under the transgender umbrella. I may call myself agender or nonbinary or such, because I'm not exactly happy with my social designation as a member of the socially constructed category of &quot;guys&quot; or &quot;men&quot; or &quot;dudes&quot; or, the most cringe-worthy, &quot;bros&quot;.</p>
<p>And if I felt identification with the social category of the opposite sex, e.g. if I felt happy from the idea of mingling with the &quot;girls&quot; or &quot;gals&quot; or &quot;women&quot; then I may even call myself a trans woman, still without necessarily suffering a debilitating health condition.</p>
<p>A person who is a &quot;cisgender man&quot; then, is a person who is comfortable with his membership of the category called men, guys, dudes, or bros. He naturally feels discomfort when faced with the suggestion that he's instead a women or a girl. (Misgendering, under this logic, is equally horrible for all people, not just for people with gender dysphoria. Because it's not about your psychological problem being triggered; it's just a natural reaction of your inner self.)</p>
<p>And if you can't already see the problem with this, please hold on to your chairs tightly now.</p>
<p>To me, all of that sounds an awful lot like a white person feeling content with being a member of the socially constructed &quot;white race.&quot; It's one thing to acknowledge that one was born as a member of the socially constructed &quot;white race&quot; and that this accords one unjust privileges in society; it's another thing to identify with this &quot;race&quot; and feel content with it.</p>
<p>I cannot see how male people identifying with the socially constructed category of men is anything else than having a lack of understanding that they are living under a male supremacist system that has assigned them into that category, and has thus accorded them with unjust privileges. In the worst case, it may even be tied to a conscious, intentional support for male supremacy and the devaluing of women. &quot;Bros before hoes,&quot; remember?</p>
<p>In an ideal world, people observe sexual dimorphism and what sex they're a member of, but don't assign any further values to this, such as thinking it naturally divides <em>persons</em> into two social groups (rather than just dividing human bodies into two medical categories).</p>
<p>Further, if a man feels horror towards the suggestion that he may be a woman, is that anything but misogyny?</p>
<p>In line with this, I won't ever call myself &quot;agender&quot; or &quot;nonbinary&quot;. Instead, I acknowledge that I was born into male privilege because of the shape of my genitals, and merely got the short end of the stick in some regards relative to other males, because I happen to have a quirkier and perhaps less masculine personality than the average guy. This led to my disidentification with &quot;bros&quot;, and an easier acceptance of feminist ideals that criticize the social construction of men and women, but it doesn't give me a get out of male privilege for free card.</p>
<p>This feminist consciousness that I try to uphold is one which <em>every</em> man should have, and every man should feel bad if he finds himself cozying up with his &quot;bros&quot; and seeing women as a natural &quot;other&quot; to him.</p>
<p>But instead, &quot;cisgender&quot; normalizes that male group identification, that othering of women, by saying that identification with &quot;man&quot; is inborn for most males, that is &quot;cis&quot; males.</p>
<p>So I ask you:</p>
<p>How can &quot;transgender&quot; and &quot;cisgender&quot; <em>not</em> be defined based on a psychological disorder, while at the same time <em>not</em> normalizing men identifying with manhood?</p>
<p>If a cis man is a man identifying as a man, shouldn't all men begin to identify as agender or nonbinary or bigender or genderfluid, seeing cis men as politically ignorant or backwards? Should we all begin to identify as trans?</p>
<p>Or should we spare the word &quot;transgender&quot; for people who experience a health condition with regard to their relationship to their body and a phobic reaction (not a political critique, but a phobic reaction) towards biology-based sex categorization, and undertake medical procedures as a coping mechanism?</p>
