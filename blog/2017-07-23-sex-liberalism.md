*Content warning: prostitution, pedophilia, incest, sexual violence*

Saturday was a bad day.  First I found out that @shaun_jen, who I know
from his videos pointing out the stupidity of Anita Sarkeesian
"critics" (good work on that), is in support of your average porn-sick
trans activist Zinnia Jones.  Then I saw a tweet by @absurdistwords,
who I've been following with the hope of getting more insight into
race issues, saying that getting fucked for money isn't much different
from driving a taxi.  I kind of lost it at that point.

Sober again now, I decided I'd write about sex liberal ideology and
how crooked it is.  I touched upon this in my previous piece on
pedophilia, but I think it wasn't very good.  I'll focus more
generally on sex liberal ideology this time.

So here's everything that's wrong with mainstream sex liberalism.


## "There's nothing special about sex"

The core tenet of the ideology is that sex is like any other arbitrary
activity.  There's nothing "special" about it.  This statement comes
as an opposition to socially conservative morals about sexuality, in
which it's made a taboo subject and "indecent" to talk about and
amoral to exercise frivolously.  Things would be easy if everything
was black and white and "anti-conservative" automatically meant
progressive and good.  Needless to say, it's never that simple.

Apart from leading to the idiotic statement that "sex work is just
work" (which I'll revisit later), there are two very damning
implications of this idea.

Firstly, if sex is nothing special, why is it such a pernicious crime
to take sexual advantage of someone while they're drunk?  If sex is
nothing special at all, then being made to have sex while too drunk to
consent should be no biggie.  A bit rude maybe, but not a serious
crime.  In this way, the "sex is nothing special" mentality leads
fairly directly to justification of rape, so long as the rape doesn't
include physical coercion or violence.  Further, it leads to victim
blaming: the woman who feels violated after sobering up is said to
have a "prudish" reaction when she feels violated.  Using her body for
sexual pleasure while she's unconscious, the logic goes under the "sex
is nothing special" mantra, is not much different from using her
kitchen utensils without asking her first.  My general feeling is that
there is indeed an abundance of young men who think exactly like this
when it comes to sex, which is one of the core tenets of rape culture.
They seriously refuse to understand the graveness of non-consensual
sex, because they don't see sex as anything significant, so why should
there be such a strict informed consent requirement around it?

Secondly, this logic leads pretty soon to pedophile apologia.  Most
people hooked on sex liberal ideology refrain from considering (let
alone expressing) this view because it has been made a massive taboo,
but it *is* a logical conclusion of the ideology, so people will come
back to it again and again.  It was there in earlier days of the sex
liberal movement (see e.g. Allen Ginsberg), and surely it will surface
again if we aren't sufficiently vigilant against it.  Pedophile
apology is a logical conclusion of "sex is nothing special" because if
indeed it's nothing special, why should it not be OK for children to
take part in, so long as they aren't physically coerced or hurt?  In
the ensuing Twitter debate with @absurdistwords and his followers
about "sex work," people have compared sex to cooking, and to reading
books to a child.  (These were in response to me pointing out that sex
is a particularly intimate activity and not a form of labor; the
counter-argument was that it can be either, like cooking for one's
family vs. as work, or reading books to one's own children vs. as part
of work in a Kindergarten.)  If sex can be just work in the same way
that cooking can be work and reading books to a child can be just
work, then the logical conclusion is that sex is comparable in a
general sense to cooking, or reading books to children.  If it's that
trivial of an activity, one is forced to assume it's fine to do it
with children.  One could be cooking for one's child, or one's teenage
child could be cooking for one, so I suppose they could as well be
having sex?  (So long as it's safe sex to prevent inbreeding!)  An
adult could be reading a book to a child, or they could be sexually
touching each other?  All just arbitrary forms of intimacy, after all?

Side-note: although I haven't read his paper in full, my ideas were
influenced in part by David Benatar's paper "Two Views of Sexual
Ethics: Promiscuity, Pedophilia, and Rape."  Reading the abstract of
the paper already made it click with me, after which I've developed
the above thoughts.  He seems like kind of a weirdo so, strange minds
think alike I suppose.  Here's an article discussing the content of
said paper:

The stock response to my complaints about sex liberal ideology leading
to rape and pedophile apology would probably be an appeal to the
notion that sex requires informed consent.  But that in itself is an
admission that there's something special about it.  One doesn't
require a child's informed consent to read a book to them.  Why does
one require informed consent before initiating sexual contact?  You
are forced to admit that there's a significant difference at this
point.  But can you tell me what it is?  Feminism-influenced sex
liberals at least intuitively know that there's something special
about sex, hence the understanding that non-consensual sex is a
special kind of horrible, and yet all is fine when there's an
economically coerced "informed consent," even at the absence of true
willingness?  Aren't we just fooling ourselves to justify pornography
and prostitution?  Shouldn't it be obvious that people who are deep
into selling sex suffer from a form of desensitization?  If you think
sex without a woman's consent is horrible but sex without her true
willingness is fine, you're simply cutting your feminism at half.
You're cutting your commitment against rape culture at half.  "That
rape is bad, this rape is OK."  Yes, sex without willingness is rape,
"informed consent" be damned.  Sweatshop workers give their informed
consent too, yet I don't hear any silly mantras like "sweat factories
are just factories!"  We know it's abuse, "informed consent" or not.

Another side-note: enthusiastic willingness is necessary but not
sufficient.  Sex is good when there is BOTH enthusiastic willingness
and informed consent.  Contrary to popular misconception, children are
often groomed into enthusiastic willingness to sexual performances by
abusers.  This doesn't mean they won't feel violated as they grow
older.  The social misunderstanding around this topic causes some
victims of child sexual abuse to feel a doubled shame.  See the book
"The Trauma Myth" by Susan Clancy regarding this topic.


## OK but WHAT makes sex special?

This is where it's getting complicated, and I may not be able to give
a 100% answer.  This is in part because, I think, the "specialty"
applies to a bigger degree to women than men, and I'm not a woman.
I'm very sensitive by nature, but have also been desensitized in some
ways by pornography.  It's also a very emotional topic, in the sense
that a collection of lived experiences form a person's intuitive
understanding of the situation, without them necessarily having the
words to describe it in fully objective terms.  Which doesn't mean
there's no objective truth behind it; only that a person's perception
of reality can be so different due to their different experience of
life in total, that they aren't able to grasp, for instance, what is
really meant with particular uses of some common words.

I'm definitely not suggesting that the increased specialty of sex for
women is by nature by the way; i.e. the conservative trope that women
are pure creatures by nature and that sex is carnal by nature and
therefore in contradiction with women's nature.

Rather, I think, the "specialty" of sex, especially for women, is a
result of men's sexual sadism upon women under patriarchy, as well as
the associated inter-generational trauma and fear that's passed on
from women to girls, the sexual shame social conservatives continue to
instill in girls, and the all together resulting climate in which sex
that is "committed" by men "upon" women functions as a form of
dominance display, humiliation, and control.

It is this climate that lead some of the most radical feminists to
conclude, as far as I understand, that true consent and sexual freedom
for women is simply not possible under patriarchy.  That one either
submits through naivete, or becomes politically conscious, and once
one is conscious, one either chooses to submit to a "good enough" man
or decides never to submit.  An authentically free sexuality, under
this view, is made an impossibility for women through a social fabric
that instills a dominance and submission paradigm of sexuality into
the deepest corners of every individual's mind; to convince oneself
that one can be individually free of this is to fool oneself.

While I find this to be a respectable and very useful position to
understand, one need not agree with it in full to point out the
crookedness of sex liberal ideology.  The two views could be said to
be polar opposites, and it's fine to find a point in between, or
attempt to combine the better parts of both.

To expound on the position: some common linguistic constructs in the
English language that represent this cultural mentality towards sex as
a form of dominance and submission are: the notion that man fucks
woman -- subject verb object (credit: Catharine MacKinnon), or the
notion that someone is "fucked" or "got fucked" when something
particularly bad happened to them.  I remember a past employer of
mine, a young porn-loving man, using the phrase "getting fucked in the
ass" to talk about a bad situation in one of his company-internal
presentations.  Something tells me that despite their "sex liberal"
attitudes, men like this are probably not very keen on having their
prostate stimulated via phallic objects.  One has to wonder why!

Another result (and circularly, a cause) of our situation with sex is
that about 82% of scenes in best-selling pornography contain acts of
physical violence against women, 90% of scenes show women giving oral
sex to men, more scenes show them getting anally penetrated than
showing them receiving oral sex from men, many scenes contain the
horrid "ass to mouth" sequence that is colloquially referred to as
"making her eat shit" and so on.  (credit: Bridges et al., 2010)

This should be sufficient to sum up the reasons for the "specialty" of
sex under patriarchy.


## What are the implications?

We've established that sex is special under patriarchy (in a negative
way) due to the predatory sexual behavior of men, and this kind of
explains why it would require informed consent: as depressing as it
sounds, you sort of take responsibility over the fact that your
partner could make you feel violated through the sex.

But I haven't elaborated much on why sincere willingness is equally
important.

One of the main things a sexual sadist gets off of is the knowledge
that his victim hates what's going on.  In other words, that his
victim isn't *willing*.  How thrilling do you suppose it is for the
sadist to know that his victim isn't willing, yet *consents*?  If that
sounds like complete submission, it's because it is.  Some of the more
privileged sex workers may negotiate what acts are and aren't allowed
and retain some amount of control, but even that exchange normalizes
the behavior of using someone for sexual pleasure despite their lack
of willingness.  This behavior ties directly into the larger problem
with men and sexuality.  Their callousness and sadism when their dicks
are involved.  Their desire to feel control over the women they fuck.

Under capitalism, employers make money off of the unwilling consent of
their workers.  Under patriarchy, men get sexual pleasure from the
unwilling consent of women.  To regulate prostitution is indeed in a
sense like regulating employment: it justifies the larger system of
oppression by reducing, not eliminating, its harms.  The system
remains intact.

And yet there is a also crucial difference between capitalism and
prostitution, in that the exploitation within the former concerns
making the workers produce goods, whereas the exploitation within the
latter concerns the *direct* expression of bodily dominance over the
prostituted person for carnal pleasure.  That is, once more, the
"specialty" of sex under patriarchy.  Capitalism involves coercion to
labor; prostitution involves coercion to explicit and direct physical
submission to another person.  This is why people in prostitution
suffer disproportionate amounts of physical and sexual violence.

Prostitution is one of the main incarnations of patriarchal sexuality.
The only other institution in which men exercise a similar dominance
over women, to my knowledge, is the traditional relationship between
man and woman.  (Historically mainly in the form of marriage, nowadays
also among non-married couples involving a controlling boyfriend.)
And now take a look at domestic violence and within-relationship rape
statistics, and tell me there isn't a link to be drawn to the violence
within prostitution.  Where ever men get "intimate" with women,
there's a risk factor involved for the woman.

I hope this makes it clearer why there's a fundamental problem with a
system in which men can pay money to get "intimate" access to women
regardless of their willingness.  Saying "sex work is just work" is
exactly in line with saying "sex is nothing special."  The latter
erases the wholesale problem with male sexuality under patriarchy; the
former is a focused version that erases specifically the same problems
within prostitution.

A commitment to the principle of sincere willingness within sex, on
the other hand, is a solid way to fight rape culture.

If you want to learn more about the radical feminist perspective on
sexuality and critique of sex liberalism, I can always recommend books
by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon.  Further, the book "The Sex
Liberals and the Attack on Feminism" regards itself with this issue
specifically, containing articles by a wide range of radical feminist
women and collectives, including even one article that explains the
ideology of radical abstinence.  These books can be found in radical
feminist archives in digital form for no cost: http://radfem.org/
