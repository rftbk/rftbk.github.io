<p>Not only the word &quot;woman&quot; but even &quot;female&quot; may not be used anymore to refer to female people i.e. women, because it would exclude transgender males, and &quot;erroneously&quot; include transgender females.</p>

<p>Planned Parenthood has used the term &quot;menstruators&quot; to refer to women who menstruate, to avoid implying that only women menstruate. Some men and &quot;nonbinary&quot; people also menstruate, you see.</p>

<p>According to the web comic Assigned Male, 5.8K followers on Twitter, 106K Likes and 105K followers on Facebook, a person's body is of the sex they identify with. In other words, a penis is a female organ if it belongs to a transwoman.</p>

<p>It has become a popular, mainstream position in transgender activism to claim that biological sex is a social construction.</p>
