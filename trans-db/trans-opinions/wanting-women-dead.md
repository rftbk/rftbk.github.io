A lot of people slurring women as "TERFs" gleefully express their
wishes of extreme violence, sexual assault, and death upon them.

Has anyone *ever* seen a person who is part of a radical feminist
community speak like this against members of an oppressed class of
people?  (If you have, notify me on Twitter/@rftbk and I'll remove
this paragraph.)
