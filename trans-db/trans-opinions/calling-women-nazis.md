Heather Hogan thinks that lesbians who speak out against lesbophobia
in "queer" communities are comparable to the "alt-right" (which is
understood to be a euphemism for neo-Nazi in leftist circles).

Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer, a man who calls
himself a "genderqueer femme" and demands to be called by female
pronouns, claims that women who he slurs as "TERFs" want transgender
people dead.

The website TheTERFs claims that women who don't accept men as women /
women who opine that surgically removing healthy genital tissue is
mutilation, are therefore excluding them from housing, employment,
education, accommodation equality, as well as local, state, national
and United Nations protections.

(I sure wish there were collectives of women with such massive
political power.  The world would probably be a better place.)

Cristan Williams from the popular transgender opinion piece website
The TransAdvocate thinks that lesbian radical feminist activist Janice
Raymond has "blood on her hands" for stating, in a report requested by
the government, that sex reassignment surgery is controversial on
ethical grounds.
