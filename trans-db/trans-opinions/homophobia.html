<p>Adherents of trans ideology think it's transphobic to define gay and lesbian identity as &quot;exclusively having sex with people of the same sex as you.&quot; In other words, they find the very definition of homosexuality to be transphobic.</p>

<p>Riley J. Dennis, a transgender male who identifies as a &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;pansexual&quot; and proudly undertakes no medical operations to make him any less biologically male (meaning obviously he has a penis) argues that &quot;genital preferences are transphobic.&quot; In plaintext, this means that if a lesbian <em>categorically</em> rejects men like him, then she is a transphobe. In other words, a lesbian is obliged to <em>consider</em> male sex partners as a category (given they &quot;identify as a woman&quot;) and may only reject them on an individual basis, otherwise she is unjustly discriminating against them.</p>
<p>Dennis has 27k subscribers on YouTube, 9k followers on Twitter, and writes for Everyday Feminism.</p>
