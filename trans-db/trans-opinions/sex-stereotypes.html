<p>In accounts of &quot;transgenderism&quot; in children, reference to sex-based roles and stereotypes often take the spotlight.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>They had presumed their prancing, pink-loving son who squirreled away cousins’ girl toys was gay… He wore sweatpants around his head to mimic ponytails and dressed as a princess for Halloween. And he hated boy things – especially his body.[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sources said the youngster had confided in friends that he wanted to be a girl and would put on a bikini to go swimming and use a Barbie towel. He rode to primary school on a pink scooter and wore pink ribbons in his hair.[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While Blaine preferred playing with trucks and cars, Keat liked dolls. At school he liked playing dress up with the princess dresses… Keat was so happy in her skin but I dreaded that first day back at school where she would be going back to class with pigtails and a pink backpack.[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She grew her hair out, pierced her ears, and wore dresses everywhere – even to kindergarten… growing up Jazz’s bedroom was filled with girly things – pink bed linen, a closet filled with dresses and an ample collection of stuffed animals.[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When she chats with people, she introduces herself as, “Hi, I’m Sadie, my favorite color is pink, I’m vegan, and I’m transgender. Who are you?”‘ Sage said.[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m wishing for the one I love to find me!” the preschooler would enthusiastically sing into the toilet, copying Snow White, who sings into the echoing wishing well in the animated Disney movie. Six months after her second birthday, her parents say Ryan was drawn to all things pink and sparkly. Ryan, the boy, wore pajama pants on his head, pretending it was long hair, or acted out girl roles from movies.[6]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Danann Tyler, who was born male but now dresses as a little girl and has long hair,… he never had any interest in the toys his elder brother Liam had loved. His sippy cup had to be pink. When a family friend playing dress up put him in a princess gown, he refused to take it off.[7]</p>

<h3 id="miranda-yardleys-commentary">Miranda Yardley's commentary</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The commonality of these narratives is striking, within these seven stories mention is made of the following: a preference for pink (7/7), hair (6/7), princesses and dresses (5/7), ‘toys for girls’ (5/7).</p>
<p>As an example, the association of pink with girls is itself cultural; devoid of culture, pink has no meaning with respect to the preferences of children, or even adults, of either sex. If we can accept that one’s “gender identity” is preference for the cultural conventions applicable to a particular sex, is it such a leap to suggest that for girls who are masculine (or boys who are feminine), such personality traits are being interpreted as an indicator that the child’s “gender identity” is not correspondent with the child’s sex? Is this not tantamount to suggesting that personality determines sex?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was very concerned, because at the time <strong>I was leading a small ministry at my church and teaching Bible study,</strong> and here I have this kid who <strong>people in my family were flat asking me if this kid was gay.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The family tried to redirect Kai to more “masculine” pursuits ― hunting, fishing, sports ― and <strong>Shappley punished her when she did anything “feminine.”</strong> By 3, Kai was pulling T-shirts down around her waist to make skirts and tying long-sleeve shirts around her head to make long hair.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By 3-and-a-half, Kai was verbalizing that she was a girl six times a day or more, <strong>which would lead to time-outs, <em>spankings</em> and yelling matches.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It got to the point where Kai would wait until your hands were full, or you were busy, and she knew that you couldn’t come after her and she would march into the room and say, ‘You know I’m a girl!’ just so that she could get her point across.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She overheard her child praying to God to take “Joseph,” Kai’s birth name, away to be with Jesus, and realized she was essentially overhearing <strong>a prayer for death</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(All emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>This is supposed to be a database and not a blog, but at this point I have to insert some longer commentary:</p>
<p>Dare I say, this is <strong>psychological torturing of a feminine boy</strong>.</p>
<p>The child is lead to believe that his personality, which he rightfully resists changing according to society's whims of how a boy &quot;ought to be&quot;, is proof that he is really a girl.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to change a child's deeply held preferences in life, and perhaps downright impossible to do so with straightforward punishment. (Unless perhaps if we're talking about intensive physical violence committed against the child, which at least was spared this child. Others may be even less fortunate, suffering e.g. beatings from a father for being too effeminate.) The child naturally reacts with stubbornness against the mother's punishment, and goes back to expressing himself the way he likes, playing with the toys he prefers. To stop doing so would not merely require the child to <em>change his beliefs</em>; it would require changing <em>deeply felt emotions</em> towards certain ways of dressing and playing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ideas such as &quot;boys don't wear skirts or dresses,&quot; &quot;boys don't play with dolls,&quot; &quot;boys don't act flamboyant like that&quot; and so on are mere <em>information</em>, offered as objective facts to the child, which the child can learn and accept. It is much easier to change an <em>objective belief</em> than a <em>subjective feeling</em>.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion the child then reaches is: &quot;I am not a boy. I am obviously a girl. How can they not see this?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 years of trying to force her to be a boy. 4 years of xmas lists asking for barbies and unicorns etc and we bought trucks etc &amp; saw tears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, an effeminate boy being pressured to accept roles and stereotypes of masculinity. When the child resists, the conclusion is that the child is &quot;really a girl.&quot; It's like the logic of a school yard bully calling an effeminate boy a &quot;girl&quot;, only this time taken literally, and endorsed by adults.</p>
<p>I'm fuming. These children could have been me.</p>

<p>Transgender activists are frustrated over a New York Times article about the story of a &quot;tomboy&quot; girl who people keep assuming to be transgender. The author of the NYT story, the mother of the girl, asks for people to stop assuming that refusing to conform to sexist roles and stereotypes means one must be transgender.</p>
<p>Chase Strangio seems to simply deny the problem, claiming that the daughter's and mother's experiences have nothing to do with transgender ideology, despite clear evidence offered by the mother.</p>
<p>Other activists have begun insisting that the child <em>is</em> in fact transgender, beginning to talk about the child using male pronouns, suggesting to find the kid and &quot;help&quot; &quot;him&quot;. In particular, they want to suggest the child to take up hormone blockers. They seem <em>extremely</em> distressed over the mother not &quot;accepting&quot; her &quot;son&quot; as transgender. If anything, it seems the mother was unaware of the full viciousness of transgender activism.</p>
<p>The argument of the trans activists is apparently based on an older article by the same mother, from when the girl was 4 years old and said that she wants to be a boy.</p>
