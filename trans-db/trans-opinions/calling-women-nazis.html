<p>Heather Hogan thinks that lesbians who speak out against lesbophobia in &quot;queer&quot; communities are comparable to the &quot;alt-right&quot; (which is understood to be a euphemism for neo-Nazi in leftist circles).</p>
<p>She is senior editor at <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/">Autostraddle</a> and has about 20k followers <a href="https://twitter.com/theheatherhogan">on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer, a man who calls himself a &quot;genderqueer femme&quot; and demands to be called by female pronouns, claims that women who he slurs as &quot;TERFs&quot; want transgender people dead.</p>
<p><a href="http://theterfs.com/" class="uri">http://theterfs.com/</a></p>
<p>The website TheTERFs claims that women who don't accept men as women / women who opine that surgically removing healthy genital tissue is mutilation, are therefore excluding them from housing, employment, education, accommodation equality, as well as local, state, national and United Nations protections.</p>
<p>(I sure wish there were collectives of women with such massive political power. The world would probably be a better place.)</p>

<p>Cristan Williams from the popular transgender opinion piece website The TransAdvocate thinks that lesbian radical feminist activist Janice Raymond has &quot;blood on her hands&quot; for stating, in a report requested by the government, that sex reassignment surgery is controversial on ethical grounds.</p>

<p>The transgender male claiming that TERFs literally cooperate with neo-Nazis has about 500 followers. The person taking him seriously, expressing sympathy, and calling feminists &quot;literal fascist allies&quot; has about 22K followers on Twitter.</p>
