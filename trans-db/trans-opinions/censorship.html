<blockquote>
<p>shun terfs. ostracize them. push them to the fringe, destroy their ideas. don't stop until they're on the same level as flat earth theorists</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i want to make it socially disgusting to be a terf. i want people to associate insidious anti-trans rhetoric with the word and to LOATHE it</p>
</blockquote>
