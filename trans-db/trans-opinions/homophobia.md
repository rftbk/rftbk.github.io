(See responses to tweet.)

Adherents of trans ideology think it's transphobic to define gay and
lesbian identity as "exclusively having sex with people of the same
sex as you."  In other words, they find the very definition of
homosexuality to be transphobic.

Riley J. Dennis, a transgender male who identifies as a "lesbian" or
"pansexual" and proudly undertakes no medical operations to make him
any less biologically male (meaning obviously he has a penis) argues
that "genital preferences are transphobic."  In plaintext, this means
that if a lesbian *categorically* rejects men like him, then she is a
transphobe.  In other words, a lesbian is obliged to *consider* male
sex partners as a category (given they "identify as a woman") and may
only reject them on an individual basis, otherwise she is unjustly
discriminating against them.

Dennis has 27k subscribers on YouTube, 9k followers on Twitter, and
writes for Everyday Feminism.
