<p>Riley J. Dennis, a transgender male who identifies as a &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;pansexual&quot; and proudly undertakes no medical operations to make him any less biologically male (meaning obviously he has a penis) argues that &quot;genital preferences are transphobic.&quot; In plaintext, this means that if a lesbian <em>categorically</em> rejects men like him, then she is a transphobe. In other words, a lesbian is obliged to <em>consider</em> male sex partners as a category (given they &quot;identify as a woman&quot;) and may only reject them on an individual basis, otherwise she is unjustly discriminating against them.</p>
<p>Dennis has 27k subscribers on YouTube, 9k followers on Twitter, and writes for Everyday Feminism.</p>

<p>Lesbian porn producer Lily Cade was pressured by a transgender male to accept him as an on-screen sex partner in the name of &quot;equality&quot; for transgender people; her refusal was characterized as bigotry.</p>
<p>In her words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chelsea Poe, a pre- or non-op transsexual woman (a human being with a penis and testicles) asked me to cast her in my lesbian porn. I said no, and she accused me of transphobia, and it could have been left at that, but people piled on and piled on and I stood there and fought it because this whole thing is coming from a place of refusal to face reality… and I don’t believe in suffering delusion.</p>
<p>Frankly, I still don’t think Chelsea and Thelma [Sleaze] and all these other uptight, immature people understand why I went to war with them. I tried nuance and I tried grace and I tried everything in my arsenal but if you can’t grow up I can’t drag you kicking and screaming into the light.</p>
<p>What Chelsea asked me to do was to spend my capital, my energy, the trust of my fanbase that I have built up over six years in porn, to fight for her cause: her cause of proving she is attractive. Chelsea asked me to give her work in my movies. Every time I cast a movie I can’t include all my friends and lovers and the women I think are beautiful and the women who I like fucking, but Chelsea demanded that in the name of “equality” I give one of those roles to her and pay for someone to fuck her, so that she could wave her dick in the faces of my lesbian porn fans to make some point about how they should stop being bigots and accept that she’s hot.</p>
<p>Attraction isn’t bigotry. I fully support the creation of porn that speaks to all kinds of people. I do to some extent, and have many friends who create porn that features non mainstream looks, that showcases new things that maybe people didn’t know they were into, and speaks to some larger truth about the world. I’m not exactly Brazzers. I don’t make assembly line porn.</p>

<p>The concept of the &quot;Cotton Ceiling&quot; is concerned, in part, with lesbians refusing transgender males as sex partners and how problematic this is.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Cotton_ceiling" class="uri">http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Cotton_ceiling</a></p>
<p>Third-wave fauxfeminist sites like the SJWiki are deflecting with full-force, blissfully and perhaps willingly remaining ignorant to how deeply disturbing it is of a person with a penis lamenting about how lesbians refuse to fuck him.</p>

<p>The TransAdvocate, led by transgender MRA Cristan Williams, reacts by ridiculing lesbians for raising concerns over said instance of male sexual entitlement, characterizing them as conspiracy theorists. The word &quot;TERF&quot; appears about 20 times throughout the article, 80 times on the whole page if you include the comments.</p>

<p>Many transgender adherents express desire to sexually assault women, make rape jokes, and so forth. In a rather gleeful fashion, as is typical of misogynist men.</p>
