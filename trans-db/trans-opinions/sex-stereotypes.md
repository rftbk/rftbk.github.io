In accounts of "transgenderism" in children, reference to sex-based
roles and stereotypes often take the spotlight.

This is supposed to be a database and not a blog, but at this point I
have to insert some longer commentary:

Dare I say, this is **psychological torturing of a feminine boy**.

The child is lead to believe that his personality, which he rightfully
resists changing according to society's whims of how a boy "ought to
be", is proof that he is really a girl.

It is very difficult to change a child's deeply held preferences in
life, and perhaps downright impossible to do so with straightforward
punishment.  (Unless perhaps if we're talking about intensive physical
violence committed against the child, which at least was spared this
child.  Others may be even less fortunate, suffering e.g. beatings
from a father for being too effeminate.)  The child naturally reacts
with stubbornness against the mother's punishment, and goes back to
expressing himself the way he likes, playing with the toys he prefers.
To stop doing so would not merely require the child to *change his
beliefs*; it would require changing *deeply felt emotions* towards
certain ways of dressing and playing.

On the other hand, ideas such as "boys don't wear skirts or dresses,"
"boys don't play with dolls," "boys don't act flamboyant like that"
and so on are mere *information*, offered as objective facts to the
child, which the child can learn and accept.  It is much easier to
change an *objective belief* than a *subjective feeling*.

The logical conclusion the child then reaches is: "I am not a boy.  I
am obviously a girl.  How can they not see this?"

Likewise, an effeminate boy being pressured to accept roles and
stereotypes of masculinity.  When the child resists, the conclusion is
that the child is "really a girl."  It's like the logic of a school
yard bully calling an effeminate boy a "girl", only this time taken
literally, and endorsed by adults.

I'm fuming.  These children could have been me.

Transgender activists are frustrated over a New York Times article
about the story of a "tomboy" girl who people keep assuming to be
transgender.  The author of the NYT story, the mother of the girl,
asks for people to stop assuming that refusing to conform to sexist
roles and stereotypes means one must be transgender.

Chase Strangio seems to simply deny the problem, claiming that the
daughter's and mother's experiences have nothing to do with
transgender ideology, despite clear evidence offered by the mother.

Other activists have begun insisting that the child *is* in fact
transgender, beginning to talk about the child using male pronouns,
suggesting to find the kid and "help" "him".  In particular, they want
to suggest the child to take up hormone blockers.  They seem
*extremely* distressed over the mother not "accepting" her "son" as
transgender.  If anything, it seems the mother was unaware of the full
viciousness of transgender activism.

The argument of the trans activists is apparently based on an older
article by the same mother, from when the girl was 4 years old and
said that she wants to be a boy.
