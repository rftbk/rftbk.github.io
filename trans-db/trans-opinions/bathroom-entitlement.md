% Entitlement to women's spaces

https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/53tqff/documented_cases_of_violence_against_transwomen/

According to the top-voted (15 points) response on Reddit's
AskTransgender community, the main argument for transwomen's use of
the women's room is not physical safety, but the fact that they have
an a priori right to all women's spaces for supposedly being women.

In addition to being the top-voted reply, there was also no negative
response by any member of the community, suggesting this mentality to
be the consensus.

## Documented cases of violence against transwomen for using the men's room?

I just read someone on Twitter claim that transwomen using the men's
room don't face violence; that there's no documented cases of this
having happened. I Googled a bit and couldn't find anything either,
perhaps because all news sites concentrate on cases where transwomen
face violence for using the women's room instead.

So, does anyone have links to documented cases of transwomen suffering
violence for using the men's room?

Thanks.

### (top-voted reply)

More important to the argument; so what if we don't?

Are there documented cases of cisgender women facing violence for
using the mens' room? If no, should they then be forced to use it as
well?

**Violence, while terrible, is irrelevant to the issue. Trans women
shouldn't be using the mens' room because they're not men.**

### (follow-up reply by someone else)

Yeah, this is looking for evidence to defend something that shouldn't
need to be defended.

**I use the woman's bathroom because I'm a woman, not because using
the men's bathroom would be dangerous (although I'm sure it would).**

### (OP's response to the top-voted reply)

To my knowledge, the rates of violence transwomen (allegedly) face
when not allowed to use the women's room is one of the main talking
points in the topic of bathroom bills. It's the impression I had
anyway; that physical safety of trans people is the driving motivation
behind the movement. It's an incredibly strong argument too: "physical
safety of one person trumps the mere discomfort of another" (such as
the discomfort a woman may feel when seeing a non-passing transwoman
in the women's room).

Did I have the wrong impression? Is the prime motivation rather
securing access to women's rooms for transwomen because that's logical
from the standpoint that transwomen are women?

I mean, you're pretty strongly implying that, so sorry if I'm making
you repeat yourself. I just want to be sure I don't misunderstand.

### (their response)

Oh, violence and safety are definitely primary talking points in
political circles, but they miss the core of the issue nonetheless.

**I don't use the women's room because I'm concerned about my safety
in the men's; I use it because I'm a woman, and shouldn't be in the
men's room to begin with.**

Note how there are also trans people in the thread who care not to
bother women.  It's not a homogeneous community, although the loudest
and angriest misogynists seem to be leading it a lot of the time.

This is probably an extreme example, but hey:
