% Erasing women and generally fucking up language

Not only the word "woman" but even "female" may not be used anymore to
refer to female people i.e. women, because it would exclude
transgender males, and "erroneously" include transgender females.

One person suggested using the term "gestational bodies" to refer to
women's bodies, supporting also the term "menstruators" (see next).

Planned Parenthood has used the term "menstruators" to refer to women
who menstruate, to avoid implying that only women menstruate.  Some

According to the web comic Assigned Male, 5.8K followers on Twitter,
106K Likes and 105K followers on Facebook, a person's body is of the
sex they identify with.  In other words, a penis is a female organ if
it belongs to a transwoman.

It has become a popular, mainstream position in transgender activism
to claim that biological sex is a social construction.
