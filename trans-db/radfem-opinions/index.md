% RadFem opinions

This section intends to clarify what people on the radfem side
actually think, providing evidence, so straw-man arguments can be
reliably refuted.

**Things to keep in mind regarding resources that intend to
represent general opinions of the trans-critical side (such as
results of Twitter polls I've ran):**
    
Not all women in question are radical feminists.  Some of the fiercest
critics of transgender politics have pointed out that they only
learned of radical feminism after being labeled "TERF".

Rarely, there are also non-women on the trans-critical side.  These
seem to be men interested in women's liberation, gay liberation, or
children's well-being.

For each source, feel free to decide for yourself what *exact*
demographic's opinions it represents.
