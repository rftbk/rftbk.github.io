% How many are radical feminists?

I tried to assess what percentage of the women within "TERF Twitter"
are actually radical feminists.  Given the difficulty of objectively
defining AND measuring who is really a radical feminist, our best
approximate comes from asking whether they "identify as" radical
feminists.

## Question

Question to trans-critical women only: Do you identify as a radical
feminist?

## Choices

- Yes
- No
- Maybe
- I don't know

## Audience

The twittersphere of @rftbk on Twitter as of July 2017.

Number of respondents: 291

### Disclaimer

The account running the poll was not "locked" and therefore anyone
could have responded.  One trans activist threatened to mess up the
poll because they were angry with me, but didn't retweet it or
otherwise seem to cause suspicious activity.  Further, it's unclear
how this poll could be "messed up."  Will more "yes" answers
supposedly make the results look bad?  Not unless you see "radical
feminist" as a slur, which is dumb...

## Results

- 51% / ~148 votes: Yes
- 29% / ~84 votes: No
- 13% / ~38 votes: Maybe
- 7% / ~20 votes: I don't know
