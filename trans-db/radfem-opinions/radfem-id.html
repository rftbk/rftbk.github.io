<h1 class="title">How many are radical feminists?</h1>
</div>
<p>I tried to assess what percentage of the women within &quot;TERF Twitter&quot; are actually radical feminists. Given the difficulty of objectively defining AND measuring who is really a radical feminist, our best approximate comes from asking whether they &quot;identify as&quot; radical feminists.</p>

<h2 id="question">Question</h2>
<p>Question to trans-critical women only: Do you identify as a radical feminist?</p>
<h2 id="choices">Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Maybe</li>
<li>I don't know</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>The twittersphere of @rftbk on Twitter as of July 2017.</p>
<p>Number of respondents: 291</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The account running the poll was not &quot;locked&quot; and therefore anyone could have responded. One trans activist threatened to mess up the poll because they were angry with me, but didn't retweet it or otherwise seem to cause suspicious activity. Further, it's unclear how this poll could be &quot;messed up.&quot; Will more &quot;yes&quot; answers supposedly make the results look bad? Not unless you see &quot;radical feminist&quot; as a slur, which is dumb...</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>51% / ~148 votes: Yes</li>
<li>29% / ~84 votes: No</li>
<li>13% / ~38 votes: Maybe</li>
<li>7% / ~20 votes: I don't know</li>
