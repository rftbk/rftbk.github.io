<p>Almost half of trans-critical women would never contribute to a project &quot;if its code of conduct disallows the use of sex-based pronouns for people who disidentify with them.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the rest say it &quot;depends but rather not.&quot;</p>

<ul>

<p>The twittersphere of @rftbk on Twitter as of April 2017, consisting mostly radical feminist-minded or otherwise trans-critical people.</p>
<p>Number of respondents: 61</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The account running the poll was not &quot;locked&quot;, therefore the poll was public. Anyone outside of the intended audience may have voted as well.</p>
<p>To me, personally, the results do not seem suspicious though.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>48% / ~29 votes: Never</li>
<li>37% / ~23 votes: Depends but rather not</li>
<li>8% / ~5 votes: Depends but probably yes</li>
<li>7% / ~4 votes: Sure</li>
