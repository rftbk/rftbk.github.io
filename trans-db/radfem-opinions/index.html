<h1 class="title">RadFem opinions</h1>
</div>
<p>This section intends to clarify what people on the radfem side actually think, providing evidence, so straw-man arguments can be reliably refuted.</p>
<p><strong>Things to keep in mind regarding resources that intend to represent general opinions of the trans-critical side (such as results of Twitter polls I've ran):</strong></p>
<p>Not all women in question are radical feminists. Some of the fiercest critics of transgender politics have pointed out that they only learned of radical feminism after being labeled &quot;TERF&quot;.</p>
<p>Rarely, there are also non-women on the trans-critical side. These seem to be men interested in women's liberation, gay liberation, or children's well-being.</p>
<p>For each source, feel free to decide for yourself what <em>exact</em> demographic's opinions it represents.</p>
