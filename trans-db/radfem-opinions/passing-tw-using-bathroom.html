<h1 class="title">Passing transwomen using the women's room</h1>
</div>
<p>A substantial portion of trans-critical women (up to half) actually think that &quot;it's fine if a truly passing transwoman silently uses the women's room.&quot; The other half / more than half disagree.</p>
<p>However, there are about twice as many women who <em>strongly</em> disagree with this sentiment, than there are women who strongly agree with it.</p>
<p>Up to a fifth of respondents state that there are no passing transwomen.</p>

<h2 id="question">Question</h2>
<p>Is it OK if a truly passing transwoman silently uses the female bathroom?</p>
<h2 id="choices">Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Passing TW don't exist</li>
<li>Other (please elaborate)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>The small twitterverse of @rftbk followers active as of February 2017, who are predominantly radical feminist or other trans-critical women.</p>
<p>Number of respondents: 119</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The account running the poll was not &quot;locked&quot;, therefore the poll was public. Anyone outside of the intended audience may have voted as well.</p>
<p>In particular, the poll was started during a discussion with a male transgender person. This person did not seem malicious, but there is a chance they might have instructed their friends to mess with the results.</p>
<p>(That said, to me personally the results aren't surprising.)</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>50% / ~60 votes: Yes</li>
<li>25% / ~30 votes: No</li>
<li>18% / ~21 votes: Passing TW don't exist</li>
<li>7% / ~8 votes: Other (please elaborate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one of the &quot;other&quot; respondents actually elaborated. &quot;I wouldn't have a problem with post-op trans but still would not consider them female. No way to police that though.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="question-1">Question</h2>
<p>Women: how do you feel about the statement: &quot;It's fine if a truly passing transwoman silently uses the women's bathroom.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="choices-1">Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strongly agree</li>
<li>Agree</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="audience-1">Audience</h2>
<p>Same as above.</p>
<p>Number of respondents: 104</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer-1">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>There is still a possibility that the poll was manipulated because it was public, though there was no specific risk from a prior argument with a trans person.</p>
<p>(And again, I don't find the results surprising. This is a standard disclaimer.)</p>
<h2 id="results-1">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Total agree: 43% / ~45 votes</li>
<li>Total disagree: 57% / ~59 votes</li>
</ul>
<p>Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>13% / ~14 votes: Strongly agree</li>
<li>30% / ~31 votes: Agree</li>
<li>29% / ~30 votes: Disagree</li>
<li>28% / ~29 votes: Strongly disagree</li>
