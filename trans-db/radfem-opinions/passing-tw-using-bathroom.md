% Passing transwomen using the women's room

A substantial portion of trans-critical women (up to half) actually
think that "it's fine if a truly passing transwoman silently uses the
women's room."  The other half / more than half disagree.

However, there are about twice as many women who *strongly* disagree
with this sentiment, than there are women who strongly agree with it.

Up to a fifth of respondents state that there are no passing
transwomen.

## Question

Is it OK if a truly passing transwoman silently uses the female
bathroom?

## Choices

- Yes
- No
- Passing TW don't exist
- Other (please elaborate)

## Audience

The small twitterverse of @rftbk followers active as of February 2017,
who are predominantly radical feminist or other trans-critical women.

Number of respondents: 119

### Disclaimer

The account running the poll was not "locked", therefore the poll was
public.  Anyone outside of the intended audience may have voted as
well.

In particular, the poll was started during a discussion with a male
transgender person.  This person did not seem malicious, but there is
a chance they might have instructed their friends to mess with the
results.

(That said, to me personally the results aren't surprising.)

## Results

- 50% / ~60 votes: Yes
- 25% / ~30 votes: No
- 18% / ~21 votes: Passing TW don't exist
- 7% / ~8 votes: Other (please elaborate)

Only one of the "other" respondents actually elaborated.  "I wouldn't
have a problem with post-op trans but still would not consider them
female.  No way to police that though."

passing transwoman silently uses the women's bathroom."

## Choices

- Strongly agree
- Agree
- Disagree
- Strongly disagree

## Audience

Same as above.

Number of respondents: 104

### Disclaimer

There is still a possibility that the poll was manipulated because it
was public, though there was no specific risk from a prior argument
with a trans person.

(And again, I don't find the results surprising.  This is a standard
disclaimer.)
