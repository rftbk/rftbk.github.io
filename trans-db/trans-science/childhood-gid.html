<p>Most boys with gender dysphoria are able to heal.</p>
<p>Of 88 boys who met the <em>complete</em> diagnostic criteria of Gender Identity Disorder (GID), which includes strong cross-sex identification (i.e. insistence that one is, or a wish to be, the other sex), only 12 still had GID after several years. That means 86.4% of them just stopped being dysphoric.</p>
<p>Of 51 further boys who met some of the diagnostic criteria of GID, 5 still had GID after several years. That means 90.2% of them stopped being dysphoric.</p>
