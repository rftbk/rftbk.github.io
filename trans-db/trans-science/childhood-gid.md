Most boys with gender dysphoria are able to heal.

Of 88 boys who met the *complete* diagnostic criteria of Gender
Identity Disorder (GID), which includes strong cross-sex
identification (i.e. insistence that one is, or a wish to be, the
other sex), only 12 still had GID after several years.  That means
86.4% of them just stopped being dysphoric.

Of 51 further boys who met some of the diagnostic criteria of GID, 5
still had GID after several years.  That means 90.2% of them stopped
being dysphoric.

Most children who are gender nonconforming and/or are diagnosed with
gender identity disorder do not end up identifying as transgender.
