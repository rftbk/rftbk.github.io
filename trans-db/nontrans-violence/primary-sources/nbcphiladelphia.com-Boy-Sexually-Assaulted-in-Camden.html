<p>A Camden County man, who dresses as a woman, has been charged with sexually assaulting a boy.</p>
<p>Levandus Gacutan, 22, of Lindenwold, N.J., is charged with Aggravated Sexual Assault, Endangering the Welfare of a Child and Prostitution Involving a Minor, according to Camden County Metro Police.</p>
<p>Police say Gacutan sexually assaulted a 12-year-old boy near the corner of Westfield Avenue and Church Street around 10:30 p.m. on Friday in East Camden, N.J.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe he is a sexual predator who lured this young boy and sexually assaulted him,&quot; said Camden County Police Sergeant Julio Rios.</p>
<p>Police posted a short surveillance video clip of the suspect on their Facebook page and on Saturday, Camden County Police Chief Scott Thomson told NBC10 detectives found the suspect and took him into custody.</p>
<p>Gacutan is being held in the Camden County jail on $200,000 cash bail.</p>
