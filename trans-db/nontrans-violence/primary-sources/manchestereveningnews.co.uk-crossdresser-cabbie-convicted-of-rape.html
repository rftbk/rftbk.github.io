<p>A TRANSVESTITE taxi driver faces a prison term after he was convicted of raping a drunken woman in the back of his car.</p>
<p>Qasim Anwar, 30, carried out the attack dressed in make-up, a wig, women's clothing and high heels, Manchester Crown Court was told.</p>
<p>A jury heard the victim had drunk so much she was virtually `comatose' and Anwar filmed the attack on his phone.</p>
<p>The father-of-two, known in the gay village as Layla, pleaded not guilty claiming the woman was an eager participant who had led him on by kissing him.</p>
<p>Libby Nicholls, prosecuting, said Anwar deliberately decided to take advantage of his victim, after she fell from a bar stool at a nightclub after a lengthy drinking session in November.</p>
<p>The court heard that after telling club staff she was his girlfriend and he would take care of her, Anwar parked up near to a bed-sit he used in Whalley Range and raped her in the taxi.</p>
<p>He then changed back into his normal clothing in his rented flat and drove her home to Eccles. He later sent her a text message saying `Hi. How are you feeling sweet - Layla', the jury was told.</p>
<p>Anwar, from Parkville Close, Prestwich, told the court they had consensual sex twice in the car, sleeping after each session, and he admitted videoing some of the proceedings on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>He told the court she had wanted him to photograph a tattoo of which she was very proud. Giving evidence via a television link, the woman said she could not recall much of what had happened but would not have agreed to sex and knew nothing about the video.</p>
<p>Ms Nicholls told the court Anwar couldn't distinguish between fantasy and fact. She said: &quot;You were in charge. You were sober and she was drunk. You know there was a quiet car park where you could do whatever you liked to this woman.</p>
<p>&quot;You had a nice warm, comfy flat just moments away, why not go there?&quot; Judge Andrew Blake warned Anwar that he was likely to be sent to prison when he is sentenced next month.</p>
