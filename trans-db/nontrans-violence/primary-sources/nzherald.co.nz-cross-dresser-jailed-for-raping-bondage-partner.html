<p>A Rotorua cross-dresser has been jailed for raping a woman who took part in bondage sessions with him.</p>
<p>Gordon Murray Waite, 42, was convicted by a jury in June of raping the woman in her home in March last year. He had jumped out of her wardrobe wearing only a women's G-string and raped her as she was preparing for bed.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Wolff sentenced Waite to seven years' jail when he appeared for sentencing in the Rotorua District Court.</p>
<p>Waite had a fetish for cross-dressing and the woman had helped him dress in women's clothing at least twice before the rape.</p>
<p>Crown Prosecutor Chris Macklin said there was an element of broken trust and Waite faced intellectual challenges. The woman had taken part in the cross-dressing but had not consented to sexual activity between them.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a mistaken belief in consent ... crossed wires,&quot; Mr Macklin said.</p>
<p>The incident had brought other abuse to the surface but the woman just wanted to move on with her life.</p>
<p>In his submissions Waite's lawyer Andy Schulze confirmed Waite suffered intellectual difficulties and said he had also had a &quot;tragic&quot; upbringing.</p>
<p>The victim had put Waite in the wardrobe and then forgotten after playing on the computer, Mr Schulze said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite clear the victim and Mr Waite were at crossed purposes ... this was opportunistic offending,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Judge Wolff said while Waite had developed a friendship with the woman, helping her around the home and with her part-time job, the night of the rape he took advantage of her.</p>
<p>&quot;She was scared ... the genesis was crossed wires which later resulted in the tragedy that befell upon her,&quot; he said. &quot;You did not receive the message to proceed and had intentionally gone on without her consent. No reasonable person in the circumstances would have believed they had consent.</p>
<p>&quot;A message needs to be sent to the community that sexual behaviour of this type will not be tolerated ... You were aware,&quot; the judge said.</p>
