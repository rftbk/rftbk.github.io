PALMDALE, Calif. (KTLA) — A 33-year-old man was charged Tuesday with
allegedly dressing as a woman to secretly videotape women using the
restroom at a Macy’s department store.

security that a man was in the lady’s room acting suspiciously.

The woman told security officers that the man was wearing a wig and
was dressed as a woman.

That information was passed on to a deputy patrolling the
mall parking area, who spotted the man exiting the store.

Pomare was arrested and booked at the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station on
suspicion of using of a concealed camera and peeping into a restroom.

According to investigators, Pomare entered the women’s restroom with a
video camera concealed in a paper bag.

camera for purposes of sexual gratification.

Anyone with information was asked to contact the L.A. County Sheriff’s
Department’s Special Victims Bureau at (562) 619-1370.
