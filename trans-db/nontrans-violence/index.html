<h1 class="title">Violence by non-transgender males</h1>
</div>
<p>This section documents violence committed by such men, or by men in such ways, that it raises concerns over potential abuse of badly defined or implemented trans-rights laws, as well as concerns over the side-effects of social acceptance of feminine-presenting men entering women's spaces.</p>
<p>For instance, a lot of sexualized violence is committed by men who also have a cross-dressing fetish. Badly implemented trans-rights laws may allow such men to easily claim trans identity, thus get a state-protected right to enter spaces which are normally restricted to female people, and so make it easier for them to commit sexual crimes.</p>
<p>Similarly, men who would like to creep on women in women-only spaces, but currently have no means to do so because of social intolerance against men entering women's spaces may have a relatively easy time entering women-only spaces if there is social acceptance of men entering women's spaces.</p>
