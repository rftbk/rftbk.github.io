% Violence by non-transgender males

This section documents violence committed by such men, or by men in
such ways, that it raises concerns over potential abuse of badly
defined or implemented trans-rights laws, as well as concerns over the
side-effects of social acceptance of feminine-presenting men entering
women's spaces.

For instance, a lot of sexualized violence is committed by men who
also have a cross-dressing fetish.  Badly implemented trans-rights
laws may allow such men to easily claim trans identity, thus get a
state-protected right to enter spaces which are normally restricted to
female people, and so make it easier for them to commit sexual crimes.

Similarly, men who would like to creep on women in women-only spaces,
but currently have no means to do so because of social intolerance
against men entering women's spaces may have a relatively easy time
entering women-only spaces if there is social acceptance of men
entering women's spaces.
