<blockquote>
<p>A judge says the man convicted of battery, who is awaiting a sex change, could face harsh treatment in state prison.</p>

<p>NEW PORT RICHEY -- Patrick Hagan shuffled off to serve his 21/2-year state prison sentence wearing a black-and-pink print dress and a matching pink blouse.</p>
<p>But before he held out his wrists to accept a bailiff's handcuffs, the 6-foot-3, 280-pound Hagan asked for a moment to remove his jewelry.</p>
<p>Off came the earrings and the rings. Hagan struggled with his gold necklace, and a bailiff daintily helped him undo the clasp.</p>
<p>And then the bailiff tightened the cuffs around Hagan's wrists and escorted him toward the beginning of what is likely to be a particularly harsh prison term.</p>
<p>Appraising Hagan's appearance before imposing the sentence Friday morning, Circuit Judge Stanley Mills acknowledged that.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a pretty picture in the state prison system,&quot; Mills told Hagan, a cross-dresser who is awaiting sex-change surgery.</p>
<p>Hagan was convicted in July of punching a fellow bar patron in the mouth. The victim, 40-year-old Cheryl Partsch, lost five teeth and could end up paying as much as $60,000 in medical bills.</p>
<p>A jury found Hagan guilty of misdemeanor battery, punishable by up to a year in jail. But Hagan was on probation from a felony illegal dumping conviction at the time, and the recent conviction also meant he had violated his probation, which can be punished with state prison time.</p>
<p>The battery occurred in November 1997 at BT's, a Port Richey bar frequented by cross-dressers. Hagan was accused of battering Partsch because she questioned his presence in the women's restroom.</p>
<p>Mills heard testimony in Hagan's sentencing one day late last month and on Friday.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Robert Attridge argued a prison sentence would be especially difficult for Hagan, given the level of violence in Department of Corrections facilities and the hostility to which cross-dressers often are subjected.</p>
<p>Hagan took the stand to say he punched Partsch in self-defense after she kicked open the door to the bathroom stall he was in.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very sorry this woman got her faced punched,&quot; Hagan said. &quot;What happened was a hate crime. I was only defending myself. I am not a violent person.&quot;</p>
<p>However, prosecutor Scott Andringa argued Hagan deserved a stiff prison sentence because of his lengthy criminal record, including convictions for burglary, armed robbery, grand theft and dealing in stolen property.</p>
<p>Hagan, a former septic-truck driver and martial arts expert, said he has mellowed since taking hormones in preparation for surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;My emotions and behavior have completely changed since I've gone through my sex change,&quot; he said. &quot;Give me the benefit of the doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>Friends of Hagan told Mills that the incident at BT's was an aberration.</p>
<p>&quot;She's the kind of person you can call at midnight and say, &quot;My water heater sprung a leak,' and she'd be over to fix it,&quot; said Kerry Algiere, who works as a carrier for the St. Petersburg Times.</p>
<p>Hagan's probation officer, Josephine Roberts, testified that she didn't think he should go to prison.</p>
<p>&quot;I had no problem with him,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;He was one of my better probationers.&quot;</p>
<p>Attridge tried to arrange a sentence that would have allowed Hagan to remain free, working to pay restitution for Partsch's medical bills.</p>
<p>But Andringa said Partsch wasn't interested.</p>
<p>&quot;She would rather see him incarcerated,&quot; Andringa said.</p>
<p>Mills rejected Hagan's self-defense argument. Despite the testimony of Hagan's friends, Mills said he had to follow state guidelines that called for a prison sentence.</p>
<p>However, Mills said he would recommend that corrections officials take Hagan's sex-change situation into account when deciding what type of prison to put him in.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be a difficult situation, Mr. Hagan,&quot; Mills said before ending the hearing.</p>
