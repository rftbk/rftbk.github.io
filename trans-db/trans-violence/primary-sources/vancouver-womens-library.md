The volunteer-led grassroots Vancouver Women's Library was vandalized
upon its opening by a group of people, most vocal of them a man
claiming to be a woman in prostitution.  He self-righteously yelled at
women and ripped off a poster from a wall.  Wine was poured on books.
Attenders were physically intimidated.  The vandals came back later to
paint the exterior with words like "TERF" and "SWERF".
