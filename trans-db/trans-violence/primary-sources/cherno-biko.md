# Transwoman Activist Cherno Biko confesses to Raping a Transman

July 25, 2016

Transwoman activist Cherno Biko, a 24 year old male from Ohio,
confessed to raping a female “transman” because he wanted to
impregnate her and force her to bear his offspring. The confession was
posted publicly on Medium.com and titled “Overcoming Sexual Assault”:

The whole piece reads as a long non-pology, quickly shifting focus
from Biko’s act of rape to descriptions of his own childhood abuse,
and a heroic account of his own activism in the transwoman
community. He published the piece without consulting or notifying the
victim.

An excerpt:

> “Our relationship existed largely online and we bonded over all the
> little things only black trans folks can understand. After years of

I was wrong. He made it clear to me that some trans men do not wish to
carry children and it’s not ok to fetishize them in that way. The
first time we had sex I can barely remember, as it followed a night of
drinking and smoking but I know that we broke two of the most
important rules… consent and safe sex. When he told me that he felt
used and violated, I immediately apologized and offered to support in
whatever way I could.”

According to the victim, who responded publicly at length on twitter,
the two of them barely knew each other. After messaging each other on
social media they met in real life on March 26 of this year and agreed
to have heterosexual intercourse. Suddenly in mid deed Cherno Biko
whispered in the transman’s ear “I want you to have my babies”. He
then reached down and pulled the condom off of his penis and proceeded
to forcibly rape and ejaculate into the victim, attempting to cause an
unwanted pregnancy.

Biko writes in his post:

> “I was afraid that I had become the thing I feared the most, an
> abuser. And technically I did. I was filled with shame and guilt. In
> the days following I wanted to respond in all the ways my abuser
> didn’t. I listened more than I shared. I validated their feelings
> and answered all of the questions. I gave them space, read: “they
> blocked me on twitter.” But in April when their text messages became
> threatening and unhealthy I blocked their number, knowing that they

> was worried about the implications it would have on the movement. I
> didn’t want to become the ammunition for our enemies to keep framing
> folks like us as predators who need to be kept out of public
> bathrooms.”

The transman victim whom Biko raped and tried to forcibly impregnate
posted screen caps of these supposedly “threatening and unhealthy”
responses to being raped. They involved the perpetrator being
confronted over his unwillingness to pay for the victim’s PEP [Post
Exposure Prophylaxis] prescription to prevent HIV infection in the
victim.

According to the CDC:

> “PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) means taking antiretroviral
> medicines (ART) after being potentially exposed to HIV to prevent
> becoming infected.

PEP should be used only in emergency situations and must be started
within 72 hours after a recent possible exposure to HIV.”

The screencaps show Biko telling his victim – who lives in a rural
area- that she should travel to a major metropolitan area and try to
locate a city clinic that provides the medication for free. Biko
stated, “It’s not that I don’t care I just don’t have the coin right
now.” The cost was $80.

Cherno Biko currently resides in Brooklyn where he serves as co-chair
to the Young Women’s Advisory Board of the New York City Council.
