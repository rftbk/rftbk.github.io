<p>EATON TOWNSHIP -- A big question after the supermarket shooting Thursday morning in Wyoming County is – why? The shooter himself has provided at least some of those answers.</p>
<p>Randy Stair, 24, of Dallas, shot and killed three co-workers inside the Weis Market near Tunkhannock before taking his own life, early Thursday, according to state police.</p>
<p>Stair posted numerous video and audio files online along with a suicide note in which he talked about his legacy. We won't give him that platform but we went through file after file just trying to get a better idea of why he did this.</p>
<p>In a rambling note posted online, shooter Randy Stair said, &quot;unfortunately by the time most of you read this, I will be dead. I will die at age 24 and will be where I truly belong.&quot;</p>
<p>For years, Randy Stair has had an online YouTube channel for his anime videos.</p>
<p>In a Twitter account linked to that came a series of tweets at just after midnight. They led to audio and video files and then a final tweet saying, &quot;goodbye humans, I'll miss you.&quot;</p>
<p>There were videos of him at shooting ranges and numerous audio recordings, too, showing Stair had planned this for months.</p>
<p>One of those recordings detailed exactly what he planned to do at the supermarket, a description that matches what state police say happened overnight.</p>
<p>It is likely Randy Stair's letter that gives the most insight, however.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a girl who's been trapped in a man's body for two and a half decades, and I need to get the hell out. I don't belong on this planet, nor have I ever. I need to die, and I'm taking whomever I can down with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Stair wrote that a series of people close to him died starting in</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>He talked about financial woes.</p>
<p>He hoped his online videos would have brought success.</p>
<p>In the end, he wrote, &quot;I'm not just ending my life. I will be ending the lives of others as well.&quot;</p>
<p>What we haven't been able to find yet is why Randy Stair took the lives of his co-workers, except it is clear reading and listening to this, he knew he would get a lot of attention by doing what he did.</p>
