# Woman, 26, faces trial for ‘raping a man twice’

**A woman has appeared in court accused of raping a man twice.**

Katie Brannen, from South Shields in Tyne and Wear, allegedly attacked
the victim in January.

Brannen, 26, appeared at Newcastle Crown Court accused of two offences
of rape.

She was not asked to enter a plea to the charges and spoke only to
confirm her name during the hearing.

Her barrister Gavin Doig told the court: ‘I can indicate a not guilty
plea and we will be looking for a trial date.’

Prosecutor Julie Clemitson told the court the trial will last
approximately four days.

Judge Robert Spragg ordered the trial to be listed on December 4 and a
further review hearing, which Brannen must attend, on September 25.

Brannen was granted conditional bail in the meantime.

The conditions of her bail include a requirement that she must must
not try to contact the alleged victim and must live at an address in
Green Lane, South Shields.

Brannen must also abide by an electronic curfew and not enter
on-licenced premises.

Judge Spragg told Brannen: ‘If you do not come to your trial on
December 4 it could go ahead in your absence.

‘On those terms you are free to go and we will see you back here on
September 25.’
