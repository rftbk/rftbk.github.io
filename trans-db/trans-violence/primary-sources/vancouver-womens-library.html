<p>The volunteer-led grassroots Vancouver Women's Library was vandalized upon its opening by a group of people, most vocal of them a man claiming to be a woman in prostitution. He self-righteously yelled at women and ripped off a poster from a wall. Wine was poured on books. Attenders were physically intimidated. The vandals came back later to paint the exterior with words like &quot;TERF&quot; and &quot;SWERF&quot;.</p>
