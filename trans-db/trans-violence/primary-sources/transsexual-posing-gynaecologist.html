<p>A transsexual who posed as a gynaecologist and treated dozens of women at an illegal practice is today facing up to five years in jail.</p>
<p>Alexandra Svobodova - born Martin Sloboda before undergoing a sex change operation - carried out internal examinations on her unsuspecting patients.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old even prescribed prescription drugs for them, police claim.</p>
<p>The bogus doctor was arrested this week in the rural town of Bechyne in the Czech Republic, where her private practice is based.</p>
<p>Patient Lucie Hrabalova, 35, said: 'It's bad enough knowing that my gynaecologist was a fake and not qualified, but the fact that he was also a man as well is devastating.</p>
<p>'I hope they lock the pervert up and throw away the key.'</p>
<p>Svobodova had a sex change operation after travelling to Germany in 2001 because the operation was not available in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Police spokesperson Jiri Matzner said: 'She faces charges of fraud and infringing others’ rights after posing as a doctor as well as illegally prescribing drugs containing narcotics and psychotropic substances.</p>
<p>'We have 20 cases so far of people who were victims, in addition to the affected health insurance companies.</p>
<p>'She is an enterprising woman with a long criminal past. If convicted she faces up to five years in jail.'</p>
<p>Svobodova's alleged crimes are not the first time she has been in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>Six years ago, using the alias Sandra Svobodova, she posed as a lawyer representing high-profile clients in arbitration cases.</p>
<p>After swindling £5million out of her customers, she was arrested and convicted of fraud in 2009. She was given a suspended sentence of one year.</p>
<p>Among those to fall victim to her services were major Czech celebrities including pop singer Helena Vondrackova and singer/actress Monika Absolonova.</p>
