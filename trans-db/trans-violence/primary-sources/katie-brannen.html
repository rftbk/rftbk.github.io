<h1 id="woman-26-faces-trial-for-raping-a-man-twice">Woman, 26, faces trial for ‘raping a man twice’</h1>
<p><strong>A woman has appeared in court accused of raping a man twice.</strong></p>
<p>Katie Brannen, from South Shields in Tyne and Wear, allegedly attacked the victim in January.</p>
<p>Brannen, 26, appeared at Newcastle Crown Court accused of two offences of rape.</p>
<p>She was not asked to enter a plea to the charges and spoke only to confirm her name during the hearing.</p>
<p>Her barrister Gavin Doig told the court: ‘I can indicate a not guilty plea and we will be looking for a trial date.’</p>
<p>Prosecutor Julie Clemitson told the court the trial will last approximately four days.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Spragg ordered the trial to be listed on December 4 and a further review hearing, which Brannen must attend, on September 25.</p>
<p>Brannen was granted conditional bail in the meantime.</p>
<p>The conditions of her bail include a requirement that she must must not try to contact the alleged victim and must live at an address in Green Lane, South Shields.</p>
<p>Brannen must also abide by an electronic curfew and not enter on-licenced premises.</p>
<p>Judge Spragg told Brannen: ‘If you do not come to your trial on December 4 it could go ahead in your absence.</p>
<p>‘On those terms you are free to go and we will see you back here on September 25.’</p>
