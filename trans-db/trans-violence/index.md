% Violence by transgender males

This section documents violence committed by male transgender people.

The intent is not to suggest that they are more violent compared to
the general population of males, but similarly violent.

The reason may be social (grooming of boys into masculinity starting
from birth), biological (male hormones increasing aggression), or a
combination of both.

(Radical feminists tend to opine that it's either purely social, or a
combination of social and biological.  See [what leads to male
violence](../radfem-opinions/male-violence-reason.html).)
