% Secondary sources / violence by transgender males

Some of these compilations may link to each other, and some may
conflate violence by men claiming to be transgender with violence by

to show some amount of genuineness in their trans identification.

Many **(if not most)** of the links on this page don't have anything
to do with transgender, some are broken links, and so on.
